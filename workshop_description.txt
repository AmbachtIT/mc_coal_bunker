[h1]Introduction[/h1]
This mod adds a coal bunker as a station module. It accepts some coal as cargo. It can be used as a stand-alone mod but it is used as a proof-of concept, which will enable functionality for more ambitious mods.

[h1]Words of Warning[/h1]
- This mod is relatively experimental; [b]use at your own risk[/b]. 
- Put other track mods (like CommonAPI2) before it in the load order

I have learned a lot (and in some cases, copied verbatim) from mods by other coders:
